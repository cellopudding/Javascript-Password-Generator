# Javascript03-Password-Challenge
## Description 
In this challenge, I used Javascipt to create a randomized password generator. This generator prompts the user to select between 8-128 characters in length and gives them the option to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Alerts will prompt the user if they have made an input that does not meet the criteria. Once the user has selected their criteria, the generator will provide a random and secure password which can be used to protect sensitive information.
